        <h2>Heart Rate Variablity (HRV)</h2>
        <p>HRV serves as an indicator of the time intervals between successive heartbeats, measuring the variability in these intervals. The autonomic nervous system governs this variability. A higher HRV generally indicates a more flexible and responsive autonomic nervous system, which is associated with better sleep, stress resilience, athletic performance, and mental health.

        <h2>Resonant Coherence Breathing (RCH)</h2>
        <p>Resonant coherent breathing (RCH) is technique that involves breathing approximately 6 breaths/min. Studies have shown that resonant coherent breathing can increase HRV with regular practice. I implemented 20 minutes of RCH every night starting the 29th of January to see if it had an impact on my HRV.

        <h2>Calories Burned & Sleep</h2>
        <p>Since physical activity and sleep are factors that can affect your autonomic nervous system and therefore your HRV, I wanted to see how this influenced recovery. Unfortunately, no patterns were found with the RCH breathing exercises, but a pattern can be seen on rest and recovery needs after more physically taxing days, which I used calories burned to determine.</p>
